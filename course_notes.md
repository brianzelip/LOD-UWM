Unit 2 Video notes

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides a graph-based data model or framework for structuring data as statements composed of a subject, predicate, and object.
  - subject is called a resource, and this is one of the nodes that gets connected to the other node in the triple via the arc
  - predicate is called a property, and this is the arc between the two nodes in the triple
  - object is called a value, and this is one of the nodes that gets connected to the other node in the triple via the arc

Each statement is a triple, consisting of these three components
